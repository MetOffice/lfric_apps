# LFRic Apps

[![ci](https://github.com/MetOffice/lfric_apps/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/MetOffice/lfric_apps/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This repository is home to the LFRic-based science applications and libraries such as
lfric_atm and the GungHo dynamical core.

LFRic applications are based on the infrastructure developed in the [LFRic
Core](https://github.com/MetOffice/lfric_core) repository.

In development documentation for LFRic Apps is available at:
[https://metoffice.github.io/lfric_apps](https://metoffice.github.io/lfric_apps)

Example standalone scientific suites for use with Met Office systems are
available at:
* [u-dn674 - MetOffice Azure SPICE](https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/roses-u/browser/d/n/6/7/4/trunk)
* [u-dn704 - MetOffice EX HPC](https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/roses-u/browser/d/n/7/0/4/trunk)

These both run a low resolution LFRic Atm NWP GAL9 job and are setup to run
using git sources. Advice on switching a suite from using fcm to git sources is
available in each README.md.
